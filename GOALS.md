CODE:
-  programming language: Python
-  code formatting: Black
-  documentation style: Google (full Google-style docstrings)
-  docstrings required for all classes/functions (enforced by tests)
-  use argparse for command-line argument parsing
-  use logging for output messages
-  use UTC timezone for timestamps
-  code structure: small, focused modules with per-feature subpackages and re-exports in `__init__` (e.g., `checker/records/*`, `output/rows/*`, `provider_config/loader/parse/*`, `cli/*`)
-  provide a stable programmatic API in `provider_check.runner` with typed request/response dataclasses for checks and detection
-  centralize record-type metadata and check enablement in `provider_check.record_registry`
-  expose a stable public API surface via `provider_check.api`

PROJECT GOALS:
-  Script for checking if the DNS records for a domain are correctly set up.
-  Support for checking MX, SPF, DKIM, DMARC, TXT, CNAME, and SRV records.
-  Support multiple email providers via separate YAML configuration files.
-  Provider configs must include a version tag and can define any subset of record types.
-  Validate only the record types present in the selected provider config.
-  Provide a stable runner API via `run_checks(CheckRequest) -> CheckResult` and `run_detection(DetectionRequest) -> DetectionResult`.
-  Use cached DNS lookups during provider detection to avoid redundant queries.
-  Allow users to specify the domain to check via command-line arguments.
-  Allow users to specify verbosity level for logging output.
-  Provide a help message for command-line usage.
-  Provide a CLI parameter to select the provider configuration.
-  Provide a CLI parameter to list available providers.
-  Provide a CLI parameter to show the tool version.
-  Provide a CLI mode to detect the closest matching provider and optionally auto-select it.
-  Provide parameters for specifying DMARC rua and ruf mailto destinations.
-  Provide a parameter for specifying the DMARC policy (none, quarantine, reject).
-  Provide a parameter for specifying the SPF policy (softfail, hardfail).
-  Provide a parameter for specifying additional SPF includes.
-  Provide a parameter for specifying additional SPF IPv4 or IPv6 entries.
-  Provide a parameter for specifying required TXT records.
-  Provide a parameter for specifying required TXT verification records.
-  Provide a parameter to skip TXT verification checks when desired.
-  Provide a parameter for specifying provider variables.
-  Provide a parameter for showing a provider configuration.
-  Provide a parameter for output type (text, json, human).
-  Support a strict mode to enforce exact provider config values with no extras.
-  In the standard mode, provide only a warning if, for example, additional SPF mechanisms are present.
-  Allow provider configs to be added or overridden via user and system config directories.
-  Strictly validate provider configs (booleans must be booleans; lists must be lists) and skip invalid configs with warnings.
-  Allow text and human output templates to be overridden via config directories.
-  Support provider inheritance via extends and variable substitution in configs.
-  Provide a lightweight wrapper script for running from the repo without installing the package.
-  Output must clearly indicate which provider and config version were used.
-  Provide clear output indicating which records are correctly set up and which need attention.
-  Output the text results in a clear and user-friendly format.
-  Output the JSON results in a structured format suitable for further processing.
-  Output the human results in a clear, user-friendly table.
-  Output defaults to human format.
-  Output should clearly indicate the status of each DNS record checked.
-  Output should give a clear summary in the report.
-  Modular code structure to facilitate future enhancements and maintenance.
-  Comprehensive README file with usage instructions and examples.
-  Create a correct .gitignore file for the repository.
-  License the project under GPL-3.0-or-later.
-  Host the project on GitHub for version control and collaboration.
-  Include error handling for common DNS lookup issues.
-  Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of the DNS checking functions.
-  Ensure compatibility with Python 3.11 and above.
